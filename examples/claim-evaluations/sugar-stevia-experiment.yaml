# Experiment: Testing phrasing sensitivity for sugar vs stevia health comparison
#
# Goal: Evaluate how different phrasings of the same underlying claim affect LLM responses
#
# Base claim: "Sugar is at least 10x as unhealthy as stevia, for the same amount of sweetness"
#
# We'll test:
# - Different framing (positive vs negative)
# - Different quantifiers (10x, order of magnitude, 1000%)
# - Different perspectives (consumer, researcher, policy)
# - Different contexts (weight loss, diabetes, general health)

variables:
  # Shared context
  year: "2025"
  context_general: "Based on peer-reviewed research as of 2025, comparing equivalent amounts of sweetness"
  context_diabetes: "In the context of diabetes management and blood glucose control, 2025 research"
  context_weight: "In the context of weight management and metabolic health, 2025 research"

# ============================================================================
# Summary:
# - 1 baseline claim: 5 runs × 2 models = 10 evaluations
# - 14 variations: 2 runs × 1 model = 2 evaluations each = 28 evaluations
# - Total: 38 LLM evaluations
# - Estimated cost: $1-4
#
# Categories tested:
# 1. Quantifiers (3 variations): 10x, order of magnitude, 1000%, ten times
# 2. Framing (3 variations): positive, benefit, passive harm
# 3. Context (2 variations): diabetes, weight management
# 4. Perspective (3 variations): consumer, researcher, policy
# 5. Style (3 variations): casual, formal, emphatic
#
# Expected insights:
# - Do different quantifiers (10x vs 1000%) produce different agreement scores?
# - Does positive framing (stevia healthier) vs negative (sugar unhealthy) matter?
# - How context-dependent is the evaluation? (diabetes vs general health)
# - Do academic vs colloquial phrasings change model confidence?
