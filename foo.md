## About Us

We're the Quantified Uncertainty Research Institute (QURI), building open-source tools for researchers, writers, and developers. Our flagship projects include:

- **RoastMyPost** - AI-powered blog post evaluation tool (roastmypost.org)
- **Guesstimate** - Spreadsheet for uncertainty modeling (getguesstimate.com)
- **Squiggle** - Probabilistic programming language (squiggle-language.com)

We need someone who can think holistically about product experience AND actually implement improvements.

## What You'll Do

We're looking for a swiss-army-knife product person who can:

### Product Strategy & Design

- **Messaging & Copy:** Rewrite landing pages, value props, and documentation for clarity
- **Information Architecture:** Reorganize site structures and navigation
- **Wireframing & Prototyping:** Create practical designs that we can implement quickly
- **User Research:** Validate features with our technical audience

### Implementation & Compliance

- **Basic Frontend Dev:** Implement your own designs in React/Next.js (we'll handle complex backend)
- **Compliance Audit:** Ensure we have proper privacy policies, terms of service, cookie notices
- **Legal/Standards Check:** Verify we meet requirements for open-source projects and data handling
- **Documentation:** Write/improve user guides and developer docs

### Visual Identity (Bonus)

- **Logo Refinement:** Update logos for consistency across projects
- **Style Guide:** Create simple, maintainable design system
- **Brand Consistency:** Ensure cohesive look across our tool suite

## Ideal Candidate

### Must Have:

- Portfolio showing B2B/SaaS products, especially developer or research tools
- Can write clear, technical copy (not marketing fluff)
- Basic HTML/CSS/React skills to implement simple changes
- Experience with compliance basics (privacy policies, GDPR, etc.)
- Pragmatic approach - we ship fast and iterate

### Nice to Have:

- Experience with open-source projects
- Understanding of AI/ML products
- Background in research, data science, or technical writing
- Can create simple logos/visual assets
- Familiar with uncertainty quantification or statistical tools

## Project Scope

**Immediate (RoastMyPost):** 20-40 hours

- Rewrite landing page copy and value proposition
- Redesign information architecture and navigation
- Create privacy policy, terms, and compliance pages
- Implement 3-5 quick UX wins
- Document setup and contribution guides

**Ongoing (All Projects):** 10-20 hours/month

- Gradual improvements across Guesstimate and Squiggle
- Maintain design consistency
- User research and validation
- Implementation support

## How We Work

- Fully remote, async-friendly
- Direct commit access to repos (we trust you)
- Quick reviews, ship fast philosophy
- Work directly with technical founder (Ozzie)
- Part-time friendly (we're flexible on hours)

## Deliverables We Expect

Week 1-2:

- Audit of current state across all properties
- Prioritized improvement list
- New copy for RoastMyPost landing page

Week 3-4:

- Wireframes for top improvements
- Privacy policy and legal pages drafted
- First implementations shipped

Ongoing:

- Monthly improvements across products
- Design system documentation
- User feedback integration

## To Apply, Please:

1. **Quick Audit:** Spend 10 minutes on roastmypost.org and tell us:
   - The biggest messaging problem
   - One specific copy change you'd make
   - What legal/compliance issue worries you most

2. **Portfolio:** Show us:
   - A technical product you've improved
   - Copy/messaging you've written
   - Something you designed AND coded

3. **Approach:** Brief description of:
   - How you'd tackle the privacy/legal requirements
   - Your process for rewriting technical copy
   - Whether you can implement in React (and comfort level)

4. **Logistics:**
   - Hourly rate
   - Availability over next month
   - Interest in ongoing work

## Compensation

$60-90/hour based on experience

- Higher rate if you can implement everything yourself
- Lower rate if we need to code your designs
- Potential for ongoing retainer

## Why This Role is Interesting

- Impact open-source research tools used by thousands
- Work across multiple products (variety)
- Ship real improvements weekly (not just mockups)
- Shape products from strategy to implementation
