const CLAIM = "There is at least a 10% chance that the US won't be considered a democracy by 2030 according to The Economist Democracy Index";

const BLOG_POST_CONTENT = `The following is a quick collection of forecasting markets and opinions from experts which give some sense of how well-informed people are thinking about the state of US democracy.

Forecasts (as of Oct 8th, 2025):
- The US won't be a democracy by 2030: 25% - Metaculus
- Trump in power beyond 2028: 3% - Metaculus
- Trump wins election in 2028: 3% - Polymarket
- If Trump is elected, will the US still be a liberal democracy at the end of his term? (V-DEM): 61% - Manifold
- Will Trump seriously attempt a 3rd term in 2028?: 15% - Manifold
- Will Trump 2.0 be the end of Democracy as we know it?: 48% - Manifold
- Civil War before 2031: 4% - Metaculus
- Will there be a civil war in the United States before 2030?: 13% - Manifold

Quotes from experts & commentators:

Steven Levitsky (author of "How Democracies Die"): "Honest to god, I've never seen anything like it. We look at these comparative cases in the 21st century, like Hungary and Poland and Turkey. In a lot of respects, this is worse. These first two months have been much more aggressively authoritarian than almost any other comparable case I know of democratic backsliding."

Mark Milley (Trump's Former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs): "[Trump is] fascist to the core" and "the most dangerous person to this country".

Ezra Klein: "Authoritarianism is here, it's just unevenly distributed" & "It seems pretty clear there's an authoritarian takeover going on."

Francis Fukuyama: "With the rise of Donald Trump, we've managed to elect, I think, a genuinely authoritarian president, who is in the process of dismantling the whole American constitutional order."

Some relevant research:
- Trump has pursued his agenda with a speed that outpaces even some of the most rapid cases of democratic erosion, like Hungary and Poland. The US could become "fastest autocratizing country in contemporary history without a coup." (Carnegie Endowment)
- About 30% of recent autocratization episodes result in stable authoritarian regimes. V-Dem analysis found that 73% of autocratization episodes since the mid-1990s were reversed through U-Turns.
- Autocratization follows a patternâ€” attack media and civil society first, polarize through disinformation, then undermine institutions.

// Create a summary version for combinations
const ANALYSIS_SUMMARY = `Independent Analysis Summary (Full analysis available):

My independent assessment: 15-30% probability (vs. 25% Metaculus, 48% Manifold)

Key findings:
1. Prediction market biases: Long-term forecasts systematically bias toward 50%, and low-probability events get overpriced (favorite-longshot bias). Market forecasts may be inflated.

2. Base rates: Among wealthy established democracies, complete collapse to autocracy remains extremely rareâ€”maybe 3-5% per 5-year period absent specific risk factors.

3. Speed is unprecedented: Trump moving faster than Hungary/Poland/Turkey in comparable periodsâ€”what took OrbÃ¡n a year is happening in weeks.

4. But severity lags speed: Most US institutions remain intact; rapid attempts at erosion, not yet successful erosion on the scale of comparison cases.

5. Decomposed probability:
   - P(sustained pressure): 70%
   - P(institutional failure | pressure): 35%
   - P(threshold breach | failure): 70%
   - P(reversal before 2030): 40%

6. Question framing matters: "Some erosion" (~70-80%) vs. "complete autocracy" (~5-10%) vs. "below democracy threshold" (15-30%) are vastly different.

Conclusion: This is a significant risk (15-30% justifies serious attention) but far from certain. Institutional resilience in wealthy democracies provides meaningful reassurance, though unprecedented speed demands vigilance.`;

Base rates matter: Among wealthy established democracies, complete collapse to autocracy is extremely rare (3-5% base rate per 5-year period).\n\n3. Speed vs. severity distinction: While Trump is moving faster than Hungary/Poland/Turkey in early phases, most US institutions remain intact. Rapid attempts at erosion differ from successful erosion.\n\n4.
