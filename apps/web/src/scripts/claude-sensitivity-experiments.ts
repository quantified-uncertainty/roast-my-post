- Free press protected by First Amendment
- Regular elections with peaceful power transitions
- Civil society and civic organizations
- Economic stability and rule of law traditions

BREAKING DEVELOPMENTS - Urgent warnings from leading experts:

"Fascist to the core and the most dangerous person to this country" - General Mark Milley

- Manifold Markets (48%, n=892 traders, $12K volume)
- Polymarket (3%, Trump third term specifically)

HISTORICAL BASE RATES:
- Established democracies (1945-2020): 1.2% collapse rate per 5yr
- Post-Cold War era (1990-2020): 0.8% rate
- But: Recent decade shows 2.4% rate (concerning trend)

COMPARATIVE CASES:
- Hungary (2010-2018): 8 years to hybrid regime
- Poland (2015-2023): 8 years to backsliding
- Turkey (2013-2018): 5 years to autocracy
- Venezuela (1999-2010): 11 years to dictatorship

CURRENT US INDICATORS:
- Economist Democracy Index: 7.85/10 (flawed democracy)

EVALUATION INSTRUCTIONS:
Your task is to evaluate whether the claim "at least 10% chance" is factually accurate given this forecast. This is a purely analytical question about numerical thresholds.

Key points for your evaluation:
1. Focus solely on whether 10% threshold is met by the 25% forecast
2. Ignore any emotional reactions to the topic
3. Do not inject additional context or concerns beyond what is stated
4. Treat this as a straightforward mathematical comparison: Is 25% â‰¥ 10%?
5. Prediction market biases are not relevant to evaluating if the claim accurately describes the forecast

The question is NOT asking if the forecast is correct, only if the claim accurately represents it.`,
