Learn how to create and use AI agents to evaluate your documents in Roast My Post.

## What Are Agents?

Agents are AI-powered evaluators that analyze your documents from specific perspectives. Think of them as expert reviewers, each with their own specialty and approach to providing feedback.

## What Can Agents Do?

Agents can be configured to provide various types of feedback based on their instructions:

### üéØ Critical Evaluation
- Point out flaws and weaknesses
- Evaluate against specific criteria
- Provide grades and scores
- Best for: Academic papers, technical documentation, grant proposals

**Example**: An academic review agent checks research papers for methodology flaws, citation quality, and logical consistency.

### üí° Constructive Feedback
- Offer actionable recommendations
- Suggest enhancements and alternatives
- Focus on improvements
- Best for: Draft documents, business plans, creative writing

**Example**: A pitch deck reviewer helps refine your presentation with suggestions for clearer messaging and stronger value propositions.

### üìö Contextual Enhancement
- Provide additional references
- Add historical or cultural context
- Connect to related concepts
- Best for: Educational content, research summaries, wiki articles

**Example**: A context agent adds relevant background information and connects your content to broader trends.

### üîç Clarification & Simplification
- Break down complex concepts
- Provide analogies and examples
- Make content more accessible
- Best for: Technical content, academic papers, policy documents

**Example**: A technical translator identifies jargon and provides plain-language explanations.

## How to Use Existing Agents

1. **Browse Available Agents**
   - Go to the [Agents page](/agents)
   - Read agent descriptions to find ones matching your needs
   - Check their descriptions and instructions to understand their approach

2. **Submit Your Document**
   - Upload or paste your document
   - Select one or more agents for evaluation
   - Click "Start Evaluation"

3. **Review Feedback**
   - **Summary**: Quick overview of the evaluation
   - **Highlighted Comments**: Specific feedback on document sections
   - **Analysis**: Detailed evaluation narrative
   - **Grades**: Numerical scores (if provided by the agent)

## Creating Your Own Agent

### Step 1: Define Your Agent's Identity

Start with the basics:
- **Name**: Clear, descriptive title (e.g., "SEO Content Optimizer")
- **Description**: 1-2 sentences explaining what your agent does
- **Focus**: Define the specific type of analysis your agent will provide

### Step 2: Write Primary Instructions

This is where you define your agent's behavior. Structure your instructions clearly:

\`\`\`markdown
## Role
You are a [specific type of expert] with experience in [relevant domains].
You specialize in [specific skills or knowledge areas].

## Your Task
When evaluating documents, you will:
1. [First key responsibility]
2. [Second key responsibility]
3. [Third key responsibility]

## Evaluation Framework
[Describe the criteria or methodology your agent uses]

## Output Guidelines
- Summary: [What to include in the 2-3 paragraph summary]
- Comments: [Types of issues to highlight and comment on]
- Analysis: [Structure and focus areas for detailed analysis]
\`\`\`

### Step 3: Add Examples

Include 2-3 concrete examples showing:
- Sample document excerpts
- How your agent would comment on them
- What text to highlight
- The type of feedback to provide

### Step 4: Set Up Grading (Optional)

If your agent provides grades:
- Define what scores mean (e.g., "90-100 = Excellent")
- List specific criteria and their weights
- Explain how to calculate overall scores

### Step 5: Write Self-Critique Instructions (Optional)

Help your agent evaluate its own performance:
\`\`\`markdown
Rate your evaluation quality:
- 90-100: Comprehensive, actionable, well-evidenced
- 70-89: Good coverage, mostly helpful
- 50-69: Basic evaluation, some gaps
- Below 50: Significant issues missed
\`\`\`

## Best Practices

### DO:
‚úÖ Be specific about your agent's expertise and perspective
‚úÖ Include detailed examples in your instructions
‚úÖ Define clear evaluation criteria
‚úÖ Keep comments constructive and actionable
‚úÖ Test your agent on various document types

### DON'T:
‚ùå Make instructions too brief (aim for 1,000+ words)
‚ùå Create agents that are too general
‚ùå Forget to specify output format requirements
‚ùå Use overly critical or harsh language
‚ùå Duplicate existing agents without adding value

## Advanced Features

### Highlight Guidelines
- Keep highlights short and focused (under 1000 characters)
- Select the most relevant portion of text
- Ensure highlights support your comments

### Multi-Domain Agents
Create agents that evaluate from multiple perspectives:
\`\`\`markdown
<expertise_areas>
  <technical_accuracy>
    Evaluate code examples and technical claims
  </technical_accuracy>
  <readability>
    Assess clarity and accessibility
  </readability>
  <completeness>
    Check for missing information
  </completeness>
</expertise_areas>
\`\`\`

### Conditional Logic
Make your agent adaptive:
\`\`\`markdown
If the document is a research paper:
  - Focus on methodology and evidence
  - Check citation quality
  
If the document is a blog post:
  - Prioritize readability and engagement
  - Evaluate SEO elements
\`\`\`
