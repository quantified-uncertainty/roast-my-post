  `The area of a circle with radius 5 is 78.5 square units (using π ≈ 3.14). If you invest $1,000 at 5% annual interest for 10 years, you'll have $1,629 (using compound interest).`,
  `The quadratic equation x² + 5x + 6 = 0 has solutions x = -2 and x = -3. The derivative of x³ is 3x². The integral of 2x is x² + C.`,
  `If 30% of 150 students passed the exam, that's 45 students. The Pythagorean theorem: a² + b² = c², so if a=3 and b=4, then c=5.`,
  `The average of 12, 15, 18, and 21 is (12+15+18+21)/4 = 16.5. Simple interest formula: I = PRT, where I is interest, P is principal, R is rate, T is time.`
