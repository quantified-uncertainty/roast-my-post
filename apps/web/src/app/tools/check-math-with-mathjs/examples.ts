  `Solve: 2x + 5 = 15. Step 1: Subtract 5 from both sides: 2x = 10. Step 2: Divide by 2: x = 5. Verification: 2(5) + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15 ✓`,
  `Calculate: 3² + 4² = 9 + 16 = 25. Therefore √25 = 5. This confirms the Pythagorean theorem: 3² + 4² = 5².`,
  `Evaluate: (2 + 3) × 4 - 7 = 5 × 4 - 7 = 20 - 7 = 13. Order of operations: parentheses, multiplication, then subtraction.`,
  `Factor: x² - 5x + 6. Looking for two numbers that multiply to 6 and add to -5: -2 and -3. So x² - 5x + 6 = (x - 2)(x - 3).`
