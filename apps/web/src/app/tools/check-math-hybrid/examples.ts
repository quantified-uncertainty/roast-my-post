  `Calculate the compound interest: Principal = $1000, Rate = 5%, Time = 10 years, Compounded annually. Formula: A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt) where A is the amount, P is principal, r is rate, n is compounding frequency, t is time. Result: A = 1000(1 + 0.05/1)^(1×10) = $1,628.89`,
  `Find the slope of the line through points (2, 5) and (6, 13). Using slope formula: m = (y₂-y₁)/(x₂-x₁) = (13-5)/(6-2) = 8/4 = 2. So the slope is 2.`,
  `Calculate the area of a triangle with base 8 meters and height 6 meters. Area = (1/2) × base × height = (1/2) × 8 × 6 = 24 square meters.`,
  `Solve for x: 3x + 7 = 22. Subtract 7 from both sides: 3x = 15. Divide by 3: x = 5. Check: 3(5) + 7 = 15 + 7 = 22 ✓`
