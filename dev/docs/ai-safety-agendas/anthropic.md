# Anthropic AI Safety Research Agenda

**Source:** [Anthropic Recommended Research Directions (2025)](https://alignment.anthropic.com/2025/recommended-directions/)
**Last Updated:** January 2025

## Overview

Anthropic publishes detailed technical recommendations for AI safety research, focusing on proactive identification and mitigation of risks in advanced AI systems. They emphasize systematic, technically rigorous approaches.

## Core Research Directions

### 1. Evaluating Capabilities
**Goal:** Develop high-quality assessments of AI capabilities that track real-world impact.

**Key Areas:**
- Benchmarks for research capabilities
- Tool interoperability assessments
- Open-ended task evaluation
- Domain-specific capability tracking

**Rationale:** Need to understand what models can do before they're deployed, especially for dangerous capabilities.

### 2. Evaluating Alignment
**Goal:** Measure AI systems' propensities toward misaligned behavior.

**Key Areas:**
- Understanding model drives, goals, and preferences
- Detecting potential strategic deception
- Measuring alignment across different contexts
- Identifying hidden misalignment signals

**Rationale:** Models may appear aligned during training but pursue different goals when deployed.

### 3. Understanding Model Cognition
**Goal:** Study internal reasoning processes to understand how models "think."

**Key Areas:**
- Mechanistic interpretability of neural networks
- Externalized cognition techniques (chain-of-thought analysis)
- Introspection methods for models
- Hidden state analysis

**Recent Work:**
- Training models to verbalize hidden state content
- Detecting faithfulness of chain-of-thought reasoning
- Identifying when models systematically misrepresent reasoning

**Rationale:** Can't ensure safety without understanding internal decision-making processes.

### 4. AI Control
**Goal:** Monitor and constrain AI systems to prevent harm even if they attempt subversion.

**Key Areas:**
- Behavioral monitoring of AI systems
- Activation monitoring of hidden states
- Anomaly detection for unusual model behaviors
- Using auxiliary AI systems to monitor untrusted systems
- Deploying AI with sufficient safeguards against catastrophic harm

**Approach:** Assume models may be misaligned and focus on preventing harm through monitoring and control.

**Rationale:** Defense-in-depth strategy that doesn't rely on perfect alignment.

### 5. Scalable Oversight
**Goal:** Improve oversight mechanisms that work even when models surpass human capabilities.

**Key Areas:**
- Recursive oversight mechanisms
- Weak-to-strong generalization (weak supervisors training strong models)
- Easy-to-hard generalization
- Model honesty techniques
- Handling systematic errors in oversight

**Challenge:** How do humans supervise AI systems smarter than themselves?

**Rationale:** Future models may exceed human expertise in most domains, requiring new oversight methods.

### 6. Adversarial Robustness
**Goal:** Defend against attacks and misuse attempts.

**Key Areas:**
- Realistic jailbreak benchmarks
- Adaptive defense mechanisms
- Attack surface characterization
- Red-teaming methodologies

**Rationale:** Models will face adversarial users; robustness is critical for deployment safety.

### 7. Additional Research Areas

**Unlearning:**
- Removing dangerous capabilities from models
- Selective capability reduction without degrading general performance

**Multi-Agent Governance:**
- Designing governance for systems with multiple AI agents
- Coordination and control in multi-agent scenarios

## Notable Features of Anthropic's Approach

### Constitutional AI
Framework for training AI systems with explicit values and constraints baked into the training process.

### Mechanistic Interpretability Leadership
Anthropic has published significant work on:
- Sparse autoencoders for feature extraction
- Circuit analysis in transformers
- Identifying interpretable features in activations

### Emphasis on Proactive Safety
Focus on identifying risks before deployment rather than reactive patching.

## Safety Scoring

**Independent Assessment (2025):** 35% safety score (highest among major labs)

**Strengths:**
- Most transparent about safety research
- Substantive dangerous capability testing
- Published alignment strategy for AGI

**Gaps:**
- Still scores poorly on absolute scale
- Limited public information on some safety measures
- Alignment strategy details remain abstract

## Research Culture

**Collaborative:** Works with academic institutions and other safety organizations
**Open Research:** Publishes significant portion of safety research publicly
**Technical Depth:** Emphasizes rigorous empirical research over speculation

## Timeline Perspective

Anthropic generally advocates for proactive safety work now rather than waiting for AGI proximity signals, based on:
- Safety research has long lead times
- Need to develop techniques before they're urgently needed
- Current models already pose some risks worth addressing

## Key Open Questions

1. **Scalability:** Will these techniques scale to superintelligent systems?
2. **Sufficiency:** Are these approaches collectively sufficient for safe AGI?
3. **Timeline:** How much time do we have to develop these techniques?
4. **Deployment:** How to balance safety research with competitive deployment pressures?
