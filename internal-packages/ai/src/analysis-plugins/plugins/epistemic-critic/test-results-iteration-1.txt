Description:
**Issue Type:** Missing Critical Context

**Text:** "Research proves that our technology is more effective than traditional methods."

**Analysis:** Critical missing information: which research, what traditional methods, how effectiveness was measured, peer-reviewed or not. 'Proves' is also too strong - science rarely 'proves' definitively.

**Suggested Context/Correction:**
Should cite specific research papers, define 'traditional methods', specify effectiveness metrics, and use more appropriate language like 'suggests' or 'indicates' rather than 'proves'

Description:
**Issue Type:** Missing Critical Context

**Text:** "Studies show that 90% of customers prefer our product over competitors."

**Analysis:** This claim lacks critical context: which studies, sample size, methodology, who conducted them, what 'prefer' means, and which competitors. The specificity of '90%' suggests precision but provides no verifiable source.

**Suggested Context/Correction:**
Should specify: study source, sample size, methodology, date conducted, which competitors were compared, and what criteria defined 'preference'

Header: Deceptive presentation
Level: error

Description:
**Issue Type:** Deceptive/Misleading Wording

**Text:** "Scientists agree that this approach is superior."

**Analysis:** Implies universal consensus among scientists without evidence. Which scientists? How many? What field? This is an appeal to authority fallacy without substantiation.

**Suggested Context/Correction:**
Should specify which scientists, their credentials, how many, and provide citations to their work or statements

Description:
**Issue Type:** Deceptive/Misleading Wording

**Text:** "All indicators point to continued exponential growth."

**Analysis:** 'All indicators' is an absolute claim that's almost certainly false - there are always mixed signals. 'Exponential growth' is a specific mathematical term being used loosely. No indicators are actually cited.

**Suggested Context/Correction:**
Should specify which indicators, provide data showing actual exponential growth pattern, and acknowledge any contrary indicators or risks

Description:
**Issue Type:** Deceptive/Misleading Wording

**Text:** "revenue increasing dramatically"

**Analysis:** The word 'dramatically' is vague and subjective. No specific numbers, percentages, or baseline comparisons are provided. This could mean anything from 5% to 500% growth.

**Suggested Context/Correction:**
Should provide specific revenue figures or percentage increases with year-over-year comparisons

Header: Important context missing
Level: warning

Description:
**Issue Type:** Missing Critical Context

**Text:** "We've consistently outperformed industry benchmarks."

**Analysis:** No specification of which benchmarks, by how much, or over what timeframe. 'Consistently' is vague - does this mean every quarter, every year, or just most of the time?

**Suggested Context/Correction:**
Should specify which industry benchmarks, by what margin, and provide time-series data

Header: Deceptive presentation
Level: error

Description:
**Issue Type:** Deceptive/Misleading Wording

**Text:** "explosive growth"

**Analysis:** Emotionally charged, hyperbolic language without quantitative support. 'Explosive' is subjective and could be marketing spin rather than objective description.

**Suggested Context/Correction:**
Replace with specific growth metrics and percentages
Importance: 68

Header: Potentially misleading wording
Level: warning

Description:
**Issue Type:** Deceptive/Misleading Wording

**Text:** "The market responded very positively to our new features."

**Analysis:** 'Very positively' is vague and subjective. No metrics provided (adoption rates, customer satisfaction scores, sales figures, etc.) to substantiate this claim.

**Suggested Context/Correction:**
Should provide specific metrics: adoption rates, customer satisfaction scores, retention rates, or sales data

Header: Logical fallacy detected
Level: warning

Description:
**Issue Type:** Logical Fallacy

**Text:** "we expect to dominate the market within 5 years"

**Analysis:** This is an unfalsifiable prediction presented as fact. 'Dominate' is undefined, and the claim extrapolates from unspecified current trends without acknowledging uncertainty or competition.

**Suggested Context/Correction:**
Should present as one possible scenario with caveats, define 'dominate', acknowledge risks and competition, and provide the analytical basis for the projection

Description:
**Issue Type:** Missing Critical Context

**Text:** "The company was founded in 2020 and has been profitable every year since."

**Analysis:** While potentially verifiable, this lacks important context: 2020 to present is only 4-5 years. Also, 'profitable' could mean $1 profit or substantial margins. The short timeframe makes this less impressive than it sounds.

**Suggested Context/Correction:**
Should specify profit margins, absolute profit figures, and acknowledge the relatively short timeframe
Importance: 54

Header: Logical fallacy detected
Level: warning

Description:
**Issue Type:** Logical Fallacy

**Text:** "This represents a significant market advantage that has driven our success."

**Analysis:** This assumes causation from the preference statistic without establishing the causal link. Even if 90% prefer the product, other factors could drive success (pricing, distribution, marketing, etc.).

**Suggested Context/Correction:**
Should acknowledge this is one factor among many and avoid claiming direct causation without supporting analysis

Header: Important context missing
Level: warning

Description:
**Issue Type:** Missing Critical Context

**Text:** "Based on current trends"

**Analysis:** Vague reference to unspecified trends. Which trends? Over what period? This phrase is used to justify major predictions without providing the actual analytical foundation.

**Suggested Context/Correction:**
Should specify which trends, provide data, and explain the analytical methodology used for projections
