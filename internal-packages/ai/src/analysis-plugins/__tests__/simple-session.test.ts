/**
 * This test file has been removed as part of the session system migration.
 * 
 * The old sessionContext with AsyncLocalStorage has been replaced with a
 * simpler global session manager pattern.
 * 
 * Session tracking is now handled by:
 * - setGlobalSessionManager() to set the session
 * - getCurrentHeliconeHeaders() to get headers automatically
