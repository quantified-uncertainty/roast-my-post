  withPredictions: `# Technology Predictions for 2025-2030

## Artificial Intelligence

We predict that by 2027, 70% of enterprises will have deployed generative AI in production environments. This represents a significant increase from the current 15% adoption rate in 2024.

There is an 85% probability that AI will be capable of passing professional certification exams (bar exam, medical licensing) with 95% accuracy by 2026.

We expect AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) to have a 30% chance of being achieved by 2030, with a 60% chance by 2035, and 90% chance by 2040.

## Quantum Computing

Quantum computers will likely achieve quantum advantage for optimization problems by 2028 (confidence: 75%).

By 2030, we forecast that at least 3 major cloud providers will offer quantum computing services with >1000 qubits (probability: 80%).

## Climate Technology

Solar energy costs will decrease by 50% from current levels by 2030 (90% confidence interval: 40-60% decrease).

Electric vehicles will constitute 65% of new car sales by 2030 in developed markets (confidence level: moderate to high).

## Space Exploration

The first crewed Mars landing will occur between 2029 and 2033 (60% probability).

Commercial space tourism will reach 10,000 passengers annually by 2027 (confidence: 70%).`,

  vaguePredictions: `# Future Technology Trends

## Computing Evolution

Computers will become significantly more powerful in the coming years. Processing speeds will increase substantially, and memory capacity will grow.

Artificial intelligence will probably get much better soon. Many companies will likely use it more.

## Internet Development

Internet speeds will be faster in the future. More people will have access to high-speed connections.

5G and eventually 6G networks will transform connectivity sometime in the next decade.

## General Predictions

Technology will continue to advance rapidly. New innovations will emerge that we cannot currently imagine.

The digital transformation will accelerate across all industries. Companies that don't adapt will struggle.

## Workplace Changes

Remote work will remain popular. Office spaces will evolve to accommodate hybrid models.

Automation will impact many jobs, but new opportunities will also emerge.`,
