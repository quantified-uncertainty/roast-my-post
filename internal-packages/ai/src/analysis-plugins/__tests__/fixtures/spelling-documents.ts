  withErrors: `# Technical Documentation Review

This document contians several spelling and grammer errors that need to be identifyed and corrected.

## Introduction

Their are many reasons why proofreading is important in technical documentation:
- It helps maintain professionalism
- It ensures clarity of communication  
- It prevents misunderstandings

## Common Mistakes

However, some developers dont take the time to proofread there code comments and documentation carefully. This can lead to embarassing mistakes that could of been easily avoided.

## Best Practices

Its important to remember that spell checkers cant catch everything. For example, they wont notice if you use "there" when you mean "their" or "they're".

The algorithem we use for spell checking is quite sophisticted, but it still requires human review.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, always proofread you're work before submitting it. Recieve feedback gracefully and continously improve your writing skills.`,

  clean: `# Well-Written Technical Documentation

This document has been carefully proofread and contains no spelling or grammar errors.

## Introduction

Clear communication is essential in technical documentation. When we write with precision and accuracy, our readers can focus on understanding the content rather than being distracted by errors.

## Best Practices

Professional writing requires attention to detail and a commitment to quality. Here are some key principles:
- Use consistent terminology throughout the document
- Check for spelling and grammar errors before publishing
- Have colleagues review important documents
- Use style guides to maintain consistency

## Technical Writing Guidelines

The algorithm for effective technical writing involves multiple review stages. Each stage helps ensure that the final document meets professional standards.

## Conclusion

By following these guidelines, you can create documentation that effectively communicates complex technical concepts while maintaining professional standards.`,

  mixedConventions: `# Color vs Colour: A Study in Conventions

This document analyses the differences between American and British spelling conventions in technical writing.

## Organization vs Organisation

In the United States, we organize our code into modules. In the United Kingdom, they organise their code similarly. Both approaches are correct within their respective contexts.

## Optimization and Optimisation

Whether you optimize or optimise your algorithms, the goal remains the same: achieving better performance. The spelling may differ, but the technical concepts are identical.

## Standardization

Some organizations choose to standardize on one convention, while others allow mixed usage. What matters most is consistency within a given document or codebase.

## Technical Terms

Interestingly, many technical terms like "algorithm", "database", and "interface" are spelled the same in both conventions. This helps maintain clarity in international technical communications.`
