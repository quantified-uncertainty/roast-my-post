  "fact-checker": "# Fact Checker Tool\n\nThe fact-checker tool is designed to verify the accuracy of specific factual claims. It works in tandem with the extract-factual-claims tool to provide a complete fact-checking pipeline.\n\n## How it Works\n\nThis tool takes a specific claim and verifies its accuracy by:\n\n1. Analyzing the claim for accuracy\n2. Providing a verdict (true, false, partially-true, unverifiable, outdated)\n3. Explaining the reasoning with evidence\n4. Suggesting corrections if needed\n\n## Separation of Concerns\n\nSimilar to the forecasting system, fact-checking is split into two tools:\n\n- **extract-factual-claims**: Finds and scores factual claims in documents\n- **fact-checker**: Verifies the accuracy of specific claims\n\nThis separation allows:\n- Better performance through parallel processing\n- Cleaner interfaces and testing\n- Flexibility to use either tool independently\n- Cost optimization by only verifying high-priority claims\n\n## Example Usage\n\n```typescript\nconst result = await factCheckerTool.execute({\n  claim: \"The Great Wall of China is visible from space\",\n  context: \"Common misconception about landmarks\"\n});\n\n// Result includes:\n// - verdict: 'false'\n// - confidence: 'high'\n// - explanation: \"This is a common myth. The Great Wall is not visible...\"\n// - evidence: [\"NASA has confirmed...\", \"Astronauts have stated...\"]\n// - corrections: \"The Great Wall is not visible from space without aid\"\n```\n\n## Integration with FactCheckAnalyzerJob\n\nThe FactCheckAnalyzerJob orchestrates both tools:\n\n1. Extracts claims using extract-factual-claims\n2. Scores and filters claims based on importance, controversiality, and verifiability\n3. Verifies high-priority claims using fact-checker\n4. Generates comments combining extraction scores and verification results",
