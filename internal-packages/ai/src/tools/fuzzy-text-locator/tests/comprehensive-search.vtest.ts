Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

## Types of Machine Learning

### Supervised Learning
Supervised learning is the machine learning task of learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs. It infers a function from labeled training data consisting of a set of training examples.

### Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning that looks for previously undetected patterns in a data set with no pre-existing labels and with a minimum of human supervision. In contrast to supervised learning that usually makes use of human-labeled data, unsupervised learning, also known as self-organization allows for modeling of probability densities over inputs.

### Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning concerned with how intelligent agents ought to take actions in an environment in order to maximize the notion of cumulative reward. Reinforcement learning is one of three basic machine learning paradigms, alongside supervised learning and unsupervised learning.

## Applications

Machine learning has a wide variety of applications, including:
- Natural language processing
- Computer vision
- Speech recognition
- Email filtering
- Medical diagnosis
- Stock market trading

## Conclusion

As we continue to generate more data, machine learning will become increasingly vital for solving problems and discovering new insights.`;

const LONG_TECHNICAL_DOC = `The implementation of distributed systems requires careful consideration of various architectural patterns and design principles. One of the most fundamental challenges in distributed computing is achieving consensus among multiple nodes in the presence of failures.

The CAP theorem, also known as Brewer's theorem, states that it is impossible for a distributed data store to simultaneously provide more than two out of the following three guarantees: Consistency, Availability, and Partition tolerance. This theorem has profound implications for system design and has led to various approaches for handling distributed state.

Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT) is another critical concept in distributed systems. Named after the Byzantine Generals Problem, it refers to the challenge of reaching agreement in a distributed system where some components may fail in arbitrary ways, including sending conflicting information to different parts of the system. Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) was one of the first algorithms to provide a practical solution to this problem with reasonable performance characteristics.

Modern distributed systems often employ consensus algorithms like Raft or Paxos to maintain consistency across replicas. Raft, designed to be more understandable than Paxos, uses a leader-follower model where one node acts as the leader and coordinates all changes to the replicated state. The algorithm ensures safety (never returning an incorrect result) under all non-Byzantine conditions, including network delays, partitions, and packet loss, duplication, and reordering.

When implementing microservices architectures, service discovery becomes a crucial component. Tools like Consul, Etcd, or ZooKeeper provide distributed key-value stores that can be used for service registration and discovery. These systems themselves are distributed and must handle the same challenges they help other systems solve.

Load balancing in distributed systems can be achieved through various strategies: round-robin, least connections, weighted distribution, or more sophisticated approaches like consistent hashing. The choice of load balancing strategy can significantly impact system performance and reliability.`;
