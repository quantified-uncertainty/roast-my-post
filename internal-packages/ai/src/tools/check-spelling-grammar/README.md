# Spelling & Grammar Checker

An advanced AI-powered tool for detecting and correcting spelling and grammar errors in text. Provides detailed analysis with severity ratings, explanations, and improvement suggestions.

## Overview

The Spelling & Grammar Checker uses sophisticated AI to:

1. **Detect Errors** - Identifies spelling mistakes and grammatical issues
2. **Classify Severity** - Rates errors as critical, major, or minor
3. **Provide Corrections** - Suggests specific improvements for each error
4. **Explain Issues** - Offers detailed explanations for learning
5. **Track Metrics** - Reports total errors found and processing statistics

## Key Features

- **Dual Detection**: Catches both spelling and grammar errors
- **Severity Classification**: Critical, major, and minor error categories
- **Detailed Corrections**: Specific suggestions for each identified issue
- **Educational Explanations**: Learn from mistakes with clear descriptions
- **Line-by-Line Analysis**: Pinpoints exact location of errors

## Error Severity Levels

### Critical Errors (70+ importance)
- Serious spelling mistakes that affect comprehension
- Major grammatical errors that change meaning
- Issues that significantly impact readability

### Major Errors (40-70 importance)
- Moderate spelling and grammar issues
- Errors that affect flow but don't change core meaning

### Minor Errors (<40 importance)

## Best Practices

1. **Review All Suggestions**: AI isn't perfect - evaluate each suggestion critically
2. **Consider Context**: Some "errors" may be intentional stylistic choices
3. **Check Specialized Terms**: Technical or domain-specific terms may be flagged incorrectly
4. **Multiple Passes**: Run the tool multiple times after making corrections
5. **Human Review**: Always have a final human review for important documents
