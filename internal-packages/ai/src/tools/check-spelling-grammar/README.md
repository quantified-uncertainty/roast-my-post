# Spelling & Grammar Checker

AI-powered tool for detecting and correcting spelling and grammar errors with severity ratings and detailed explanations.

## What it does

- **Detects Errors**: Identifies spelling mistakes and grammar issues
- **Classifies Severity**: Rates errors as critical (70+), major (40-70), or minor (<40)
- **Provides Corrections**: Suggests specific improvements with explanations
- **Shows Location**: Pinpoints exact line numbers for each error

## Common Error Types

**Spelling**: Typos, misspelled words, confused words (their/there/they're)
**Grammar**: Subject-verb disagreement, wrong tenses, punctuation errors

## Use Cases

- **Academic Writing**: Essays, research papers, publications
- **Business Communication**: Emails, reports, proposals  
- **Content Creation**: Blog posts, articles, marketing copy
- **Learning**: Educational explanations help improve writing skills

## Important Notes

- AI may miss context-dependent errors or flag intentional style choices
- Technical/specialized terms might be incorrectly flagged
- Always review suggestions critically - not all are necessary corrections
- Best used as a first pass before human proofreading
- Multiple passes can catch additional issues after corrections are made

## Limitations

Cannot replace human proofreading for critical documents. Accuracy varies with text complexity.
