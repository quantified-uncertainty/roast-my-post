# Extract Factual Claims

AI-powered tool for extracting and categorizing factual claims from text with confidence scores and verifiability assessment.

## What it does

- **Identifies Claims**: Extracts factual statements from text automatically
- **Classifies Types**: Categorizes as factual, statistical, historical, scientific, or other
- **Assesses Verifiability**: Determines if claims can be verified through external sources
- **Provides Confidence**: Scores each claim for extraction reliability
- **Handles Multiple Claims**: Processes entire documents in a single operation

## Claim Types

**Factual**: General statements about events, people, or things ("Paris is the capital of France")
**Statistical**: Numerical data and measurements ("Unemployment rose 2.3% in 2023")
**Historical**: Past events and dates ("World War II ended in 1945")
**Scientific**: Research findings and technical facts ("Water boils at 100Â°C at sea level")
**Other**: Claims that don't fit standard categories

## Use Cases

- **Research Analysis**: Extract claims from academic papers and reports
- **Content Verification**: Identify statements needing fact-checking
- **Information Organization**: Structure factual data from large documents
- **Quality Assurance**: Review content for proper claim support

## Integration

Works well with:
- **Fact Checker Tool**: Verify extracted claims for accuracy
- **Perplexity Research Tool**: Find sources for claim verification
- **Link Validator Tool**: Check referenced sources

## Important Notes

- AI may extract opinions as factual claims - always review results
- Cannot verify claim accuracy (only identifies and categorizes them)
- Effectiveness varies with text complexity and writing style
- Check confidence scores - higher scores indicate more reliable extraction
- Best used as first pass before human review

## Limitations

May miss context-dependent or implicit claims. Performance varies by domain and document structure.
