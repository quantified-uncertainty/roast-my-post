# Fact Checker

AI-powered tool for verifying the accuracy of specific factual claims with detailed evidence and reasoning.

## What it does

- **Verifies Claims**: Analyzes specific claims for accuracy and truthfulness
- **Provides Verdicts**: Returns true, false, partially-true, unverifiable, or outdated
- **Explains Reasoning**: Detailed explanations with supporting evidence
- **Suggests Corrections**: Offers accurate alternatives for false claims
- **Assesses Confidence**: Indicates reliability of the verification

## Verification Process

1. Analyzes the claim against current knowledge and sources
2. Determines accuracy with nuanced verdicts (not just true/false)
3. Provides evidence and reasoning for the verdict
4. Suggests corrections when claims are inaccurate or misleading

## Verdict Types

**True**: Claim is accurate and supported by reliable evidence
**False**: Claim is demonstrably incorrect
**Partially-true**: Claim contains accurate elements but is misleading or incomplete
**Unverifiable**: Cannot be verified with available sources
**Outdated**: Was true but no longer current

## Use Cases

- **Individual Claim Verification**: Check specific statements for accuracy
- **Content Review**: Verify key claims in articles or documents
- **Research Validation**: Confirm factual assertions in academic work
- **Misinformation Detection**: Identify and correct false information

## Integration

Works with **Extract Factual Claims** tool:
1. Extract claims from documents
2. Prioritize high-importance claims
3. Verify selected claims for accuracy
4. Generate comprehensive fact-check reports

## Important Notes

- Focuses on verifying specific claims (not extracting them)
- Provides evidence-based reasoning for all verdicts
- Best used for high-priority or controversial claims
- Always includes confidence levels for reliability assessment

## Limitations

Effectiveness depends on claim specificity and available evidence sources. Cannot verify highly specialized or very recent claims.
