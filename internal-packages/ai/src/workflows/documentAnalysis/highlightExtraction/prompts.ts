This process extracts and formats highlights from the completed analysis. The analysis contains highlighted sections that need to be converted into structured highlights.

The extraction process:
1. Identifies insights from the analysis
2. Formats them with proper line number references
3. Ensures each highlight stands alone as a complete observation
4. Maps highlights to specific document passages

</comprehensive_analysis>

Based on the comprehensive analysis above, please extract and format ${targetHighlights} highlights. 

Look for the "Key Highlights" section in the analysis, which contains pre-identified insights with:
- Location (line numbers)
- Suggested highlight text

Convert these insights into properly formatted highlights with:
- Well-written descriptions (100-300 words) that begin with a clear, concise statement of the main point
- Correct line number references (startLine and endLine)
- The description should be self-contained and include all necessary context

If the analysis doesn't have a clear "Key Highlights" section, identify the most important observations from the analysis and create highlights for those.

IMPORTANT: Start each description with a strong, clear statement that summarizes the key point (like a title would), then expand with details.`;
